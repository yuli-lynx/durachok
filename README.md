# Durak card game

### TODOs:
- add comparison `==` operator overload to Card class to allow comparing two cards straightforward way, despite I despise operator overloading.
- allow constructing cards with strings, such as "6h", "ks" in `__init__`
- represent the whole ongoing game as a class `DurakGame`
